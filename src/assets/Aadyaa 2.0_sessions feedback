#3  Today's session was awesome.It is really great to hear Priya mam and other after a year , although due to some technical issues I was not able to interact that much even after trying again and again .But the story narrated by mam was really very interesting and inspiring and it also proved the very famous proverb" Where there is a will there is a way " . One thing I can assure all the new participants ( being a participant of previous year) that this programme will give you a new view point towards life and other things  ,which I have experienced myself.

Thanks

‚ñ™Ô∏èAnother start-up by Pradeep Rout, Suraj Kumar, and Gaurav Anand, called MachPhy.This startup is also from odisha. A stable cold-chain infrastructure is important to ensure better efficiency in the supply chain, etc .So, for that MachPhy Solutions is developing cold-chain solutions to address these issues.

#1  Today's session was really great and interesting. I really had a great time listening to Priya mam's stories. Her teachings and experiences about Personal Brand were also quite captivating to listen to and also, as she told ``Instead of focusing on Personal Branding, focus on the   Person you are" was amazing.
Thank you Priya mam for taking out time and blessing us with your golden words.

#3  Today's session was really motivational.Priya mam's life experience really inspired us in manyways.It not only taught us about personal branding but also making ourselves a brand as a person in real life.Life is also a enterprise and we have do personal branding so that we will be visible in the crowd of millions people. It also reminded me about the film Kal ho na ho live your life in present don't think  about  future just be focused .But I believe that product are very lucky in this matter that they know their manufacture dates and also expired date but we are little unlucky in that matter üòÖ. But anyways Priya mam's words are blessing . Thank you mam for this  enriching session üôèüèª
